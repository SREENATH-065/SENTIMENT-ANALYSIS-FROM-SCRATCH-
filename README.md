# Sentiment Classifier from Scratch using Transformers

This project implements a sentiment analysis model from scratch on the IMDB dataset using a custom-built Transformer architecture in TensorFlow/Keras. It avoids pre-trained models and high-level libraries to focus on understanding attention and encoder mechanisms.

> ðŸ”¬ Built as part of preparation for a research internship interview at **IIT Palakkad**, with emphasis on deep learning fundamentals and architecture design.

## ðŸš€ Highlights

- Built on Google Colab using TensorFlow/Keras
- End-to-end custom Transformer (tokenization, attention, classification)
- Achieved ~84% validation accuracy
- Compared architectural variations during training
